Problem occuring : 

error initializing emulator msp-fet430uif is already in use . I am clearing the msp430 board . I am updating the system. Facing issues with proxy I guesss. Anyways doing just the thing to clear the msp430 board. Still the error persists : seeing manuel : https://www.ti.com/lit/ug/slau678c/slau678c.pdf?ts=1701161921322&ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.com%252F
