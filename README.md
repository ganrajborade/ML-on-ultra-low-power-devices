Problem occuring : 

error initializing emulator msp-fet430uif is already in use . I am clearing the msp430 board . I am updating the system. Facing issues with proxy I guesss. Anyways doing just the thing to clear the msp430 board. Still the error persists : seeing manuel : https://www.ti.com/lit/ug/slau678c/slau678c.pdf?ts=1701161921322&ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.com%252F 

Installation directory of drivers : /opt/ti/fetdrivers . This is for your pc too. 

 

SO I DONOT KNOW WHAT I DID BUT IT GOT WORKING CORRECTLY : SO BASICALLY I USED THE RESOURCE : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1HToCzku9Y 

 

 I IMPORTED THE OUT OF BOX BLINK CODE . NOW LET ME CHECK THE OTHER THINGS TOO. Basically you just install test packages which is being given to you by TI. And then I found the code of LED blink and I found it and I worked it out.  

 

---> last thing which I did today is about the suming of the elements of the array.
